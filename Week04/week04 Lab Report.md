## Week 03 Lab Report

I grouped with Fiona and Lan for in-class labs.


### Lab 01 - Project Proposal

Because of my architecture background, the starting point for my final project is focing on space and spacial quality. I hope to design a device help people make better use of a space. Two options came accross my mind. One is that making a device detecting the change of people's behaviour in the room (in a larger area) and reflect on change in device[fig.1]. The change should aim at making the envrionment more suitable for a certain activity to happen. The other is to model a possible improvment of architectural spaces/facade from a more functional point of view. For example change of facade, structure according to external change (ie, wind, daylight). The risk of the conceptual model is that considering it as an art divice, output result in both cases may be subtle and not playful enough for people to engage.



### Lab 02 - Hook up a Servo

We tried to alter the time intervals, the angle of rotations to test the physical possiblities of this servo.

Servo properties:

- A servo rotates at maximum of 360 degrees, in other words, it is not spinning, it is a divice for positioning angles.
- Give enough time for the servo to rotate to the right position (around 1000ms).
